***

- **Did you enjoy wireframing your site?** Yes, although it took a little more plannig than I thought it would. I looked at many websites whose layouts I enjoyed and had similar purpose to mine.
- **Did you find yourself revising your wireframe often? Or did you stick with your first idea?** I changed the layout slighlty from what I originally envisioned, but mostly suck to the original vision.
- **What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?** Is there a workflow that users prefer? Have there been studies on this? How can I incorporate this but still have elements that set me apart? I did find studies, but they indicated that different audiences and demographics will prefer different things. I saw a lot of sources mention that one of the biggest factors is how a site translated into mobile usability.
- **What concepts are you having trouble with?** None at the moment, though I will probably go back and tweak my layout once I start coding it.
- **Did you learn any new skills or tricks?** No, but I did use new tools. I'm a big fan of Gliffy.
- **How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?** I can explain what wireframing is and its benefits. I can also create a quick wireframe, but making good ones will take a little practice.
- **Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?** The physical/visual exercise of moving components on a page for wire framing.
- **Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
Tedious, but //interesting//: matching the concept in my head with the page in front of me.
