## 5. Beginning CSS Reflection

- **What makes sense to you about CSS? What doesn't?**
CSS was a lot harder for me to grasp than HTML. The basic structure made sense, but it was easier for me to just create different tags for specific things I wanted to format, rather than take the time to plan out my formating with classes and ids. CSS will definitely take more time for me to get used to.
- **What seems good and bad about CSS?** Good: Easier to format things on a page with a few simple lines. Bad: You need to pre-plan what you want to do, otherwise you might end up starting from scratch a few times.
- **Did you have any "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?** No, I'm still waiting for the aha moment to click with table spacing.
- **Did you have any experience before with HTML/CSS? If so, how much? If not, how hard did you feel it was to learn?** HTML, yes. CSS, abosolutely not. I think I need to watch some tutorials to get more familiar with it.
- **When you looked at Berkshire Hathaway's source code, what were your first impressions of their code?**CLEAN. I went back and made my code look a little neater. When I did that, I found a few tags I had forgotten to close.
- **Which site followed best practices based on what you know about best practices?**
