## 4. Beginning HTML Reflection

- **What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't?** HTML is a very structured language, so once you know the syntax, it's pretty easy to use it. Like english, however, it has a few wonky exceptions that don't follow the rules, (like, the image tags don't end the same way). I just have to make sure to memorize those.
- **What seems good and bad about HTML?** Good: straight forward. Very structured. Bad: You can get as creative as you want, but your product will probably still look like a 1990's website.
- **Did you have any "aha" moments where any concepts solidified? What were they?** No
- **Did you have any previous experience with HTML/CSS? If so, how much? If not, how hard did you feel it was to learn?** I had taken a HTML class in college and had already taken the codecademy HTML portion.
- **Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list them.** No.
