## 6. Blog Template Challenge Reflection

- **What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?** The CSS portion is still more difficult for me than HTML. It's easy to know what elements I want on my page, but harder to know how to manipulate them to the correct format using CSS. Luckily, the site we created was pretty basic.
- **Did you learn any new skills or tricks?** Yes, my partner taught me how to open files from the terminal.
- **How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?** Pretty confident. I don't have problems using CSS to do padding, borders, and margins. It's other stuff that's harder.
- **Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?** Working with a partner.
- **Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?** having to check to  see if our code/changes were working.
