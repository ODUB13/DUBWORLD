# U1.W2: Blog Template - Mandatory Pairing Challenge!

## Learning Competencies
- Use a wireframe to construct a website
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins

## Summary
In this challenge, you will be transforming our generic blog template into an actual template for you to use for each blog post moving forward.

This is a mandatory pairing challenge, which means you will need to work on it with a partner. Remember to time box!

## Releases

## Release 0: Wireframe
View the [blog-template.html](blog-template.html) file in a browser. See how simple it is?

With your pair, decide how you want to display blog posts. Create a simple wireframe that positions each element on the page.

Save an image of your wireframe and upload it to this directory (week-2/6-blog-template).

## Release 1: Apply CSS
Using the command line, copy the blog-template.html from this directory into your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory.

Because you will use this blog template on your site from now on, you'll want to make it relatively generic in terms of colors, fonts, and other more personal choices. Focus on positioning each HTML element in this challenge based on the wireframe you built with your pair.

In the main directory for your [USERNAME].github.io site, create a "stylesheets" directory. In that directory, create a "blog-stylesheet.css" Link to that stylesheet in your [USERNAME].github.io/blog/blog-template.html.

Use CSS to position the content on your blog template. Once you have it displayed as you want, move on to the next release.

## Release 2: Delete unnecessary text

Since this is a template, you don't want to have unnecessary text you'll have to delete each time, so delete the temporary Web 2.0 ipsum text. If you want to add comments like ```<!-- insert title here -->``` to make it clear what information goes where, that might be useful.

## Release 3: Modify the Week 1 Blogs

*This part might be easier to do by yourself, but you can continue pairing if you think it would be better.*

Now that you have a blog template in HTML, you'll want to use it to display your week 1 blogs.

Using the command line, make two copies of your blog template. Name them `t1-git-blog.html` and `c1-chefs-kitchen.html`.


Copy and paste the content from your week 1 markdown files to your new html files.

Delete the markdown files when you have all of the information transferred.

## Release 4: Commit your changes

Now that you've made your template, you're ready to use it in the blog assignments. Add your changes to the stage, commit, and push them.

Now go to [USERNAME].github.io/blog/t1-git-blog.html and [USERNAME].github.io/blog/c1-chefs-kitchen.html. Are your files displaying as you expected them to? If not, can you find out what the issue is?

## Release 5: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
