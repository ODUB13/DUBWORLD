## 11. GPS 1.1 Reflection

- **What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?** I wouldn't say I was struggling but I was not as confident as I was post GPS.
- **What was clarified during the GPS?** Our guide taught us things that made my life way easier, like how to check status first, and how to open from terminal to sublime.
- **What (if anything) was made more confusing?** I was more confused about when to use push and went to use pull/merge.
- **How was your first experience of pairing in a guided pairing session?** Our guide was awesome. I felt like I had a safetly net there. We were doing the work but if we started going down a rabbit hole or were comptely out of ideas, she was there to guide us to answers.
- **Was having a guide there intimidating? helpful? reassuring?** Very reassuring.
- **What were your 'aha' moments?**
