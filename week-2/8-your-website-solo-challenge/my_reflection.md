Discuss the following:
* **What was your process? What worked and didn't work?** I went back to look at my wireframe and site map to see what i had planned out. I ended up removing the top navigation bar because it seemed a little redundant.
* **What would you like to add or change about the site next?** I would like to change my blog-index to be a little different and better looking. maybe have 3 different columns. I am also unhappy with the aesthetics of my site. I want to change the font, flow and color scheme.
* **Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?** Because I was trying to build a super basic site, i didn't find my self having to do much researching. I did look up CSS attributed i might be able to apply for centering things.
* **Create a TODO list of features you want to add in the future.** Add: send me an email, make the contact me tool bar into logos of the social media sites, rather than the text, improve blog index page.
* **Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
