# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* How do you manage your time currently?
> I currently use the old school method of scheuling deadlines on a calendar and making daily to do lists.
* Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
> I've been using this method for years. It has worked for me in work situations, but it was not effective last time I tried out Bootcamp. I'll be trying out new methods this session.
* What techniques did you look into during this challenge that interested you?
Last time, I attempted to use the Pomodoro method. At first, I really liked it, because it gave me a very specific time frame to be focused, and it was short enough that it was reasonable. However, as the challenges started getting harder, it was harder to follow the stringent rules.
* Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
> This time around, I plan to continue my old method of deadlines and to do list, but keeping in mind that being in "flow" will make me more productive. That means I'll need to give myself a little extra time in my deadlines so I am not working under pressure.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
> I plan to look at each week's work first thing on Monday, (or earlier, if possible). Set my pairing sessions that same day so I know when I will be pairing and can properly prepare and contribute at the session.
Finally, I plan to move my personal deadline to finish the week's challenges to a day, at a point before the last Office Hours, so by that time I can attend the OH if I am stuck with a challenge that week.
