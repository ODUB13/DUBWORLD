## 2. GitHub Introduction Reflection

### From GitHub Introduction Challenge

- Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.
- Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
- Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
- What doesn't make sense? What does?

### From Fork and Clone challenge
- Create your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions for later use
- What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
- Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

Git is a version control system, that allows for multiple users (or one user, #solo) to track changes of a project. It's a software. You install it on your computer and you're ready to roll.
GitHub is a storage place for all those wonderful git versions you are creating. It stores things clearly and makes things user friendly. It is also a collaboration tool because it let's you "git" with other's ;).
Version Control is a way to track changes to your code through a detailed log that says who changed/added/removed what and when. Github organizes it so you can always go back to a previous version without changes in case someone adds a bug to your code, or you decide you don't want the changes after all.
Developers use version contral for a few reasons, but I think the most important one has to do with collaboration. Many developers nowadays work on projects with other people. Each developer works on their part, adds it to the project, edits nonsensical code, etc. Version control allows all team members to see who is doind what to the project and return to a previous version at any time if something goes wrong, like one of the developers goes rogue and starts addign a bunch of bugs to the code.
Makes perfect sense and which more things in life could have a similar system.

Fork Instructions:
1. Go to Github repository you want to fork.
2. Click on the fork icon on the top right.
3. Click on the new repository you want to fork it in.
4. You now have your own version of that repository to play with.

Clone Instructions:
1. Click on the repository you want to clone locally.
2. Copy the URL link at the bottom of the right hand tool bar.
3. Open your terminal.
4. Navigate through your terminal to find the folder you want to clone into.
5. Type git clone URL.
6. Enter your GitHub username and password.
7. Have a copy of the repositiroy locally!

I had set up git a long time ago, so it was a nonissue to set it up. I still want to learn about more git terminal commands, tho.
