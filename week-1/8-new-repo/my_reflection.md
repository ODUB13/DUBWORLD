## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a new repository on Github:
1. login
2. go to the top and click on the plus sign next to your username.
3. Select New Repository.
4. Name it
5. Make it private or public.
6. Create!
7. Visit your new repository.
8. Copy the HTTPS link on the right-hand tool bar
9. Go to Terminal
10. Navigate to the folder you want to clone the new repo in
11. git clone URL

Open Source is love, basically. Open source referes to the practice of sharing and allowing access for others to view a computer program so they can understand how it works and modify it, if they so wish. #collaboration.
I am a fan of open source. I do realize that might mean that creators of programs are giving their hard work up for free basically. But I think it is important to share your work, so other's can take their ideas and build on what has already been created, rather than have to start from scratch every time. I hope my opinion does not change once I start creating programs lol
Open source licensing is great because it allows this access while still giving credit, (but not royalties), to the original creator.
Without some type of lisencing, I don't think the coding community would be what it is now. Programmers would be a lot more wary of sharing their work, which would impede progress.
