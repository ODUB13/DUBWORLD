# 1: Command Line Reflection

Write your reflection on a document or by hand on the following questions. Keep track of your answers because you'll be asked to add them to this document in challenge [6: Tracking Changes](../6-tracking-changes).

1. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? Memorizing everything. Going through the actual Crash Course is simple, because you are following the directions that tell you EXACTLY what to type. Trying to recreate the same results without looking at the directions requries some memorization.
2. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? Yes!
3. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-`pwd` = print working directory

-`ls` = list folder contents

-`grep` = searches for text in file

-`mv` = move a file

-`cd` = change directories

-`../` = goes to the parent directory

-`touch` = creates an empty file

-`mkdir` = creates a new directory

-`echo` = parrots what you type on the next line

-`less` = prints contents of a file, only one screen at a time

-`rmdir` = remove a directory

-`cat` = meaning concatenate. It will give you a steam of a file's text.

-`rm` = remove a file

-`help` = lists all commands available

-`exit` = logout of terminal
