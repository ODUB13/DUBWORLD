## Part 2: Reflection
- What 2 new things did you learn about the web? 1. I did not know there was a difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web. 2. How communication works between servers, routers, and computers. The 5 minute video was actually very helpful...I forwarded it to a lot of people.
- How did you feel when you saw your web page live? It's not my first page, so I can't say I was that excited. It was the first one I put up by using push on git, tho. It's nice to see I'm getting more familiar with that process.
- Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified? Yes. The whole 5 minute video I kept thinking, "That's how that works!"
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
