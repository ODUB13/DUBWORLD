# Sublime Hotkeys
Sublime has a ton of built-in shortcuts that will save you time when programming.

[Windows/linux](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_win.html)

Here are a few that I find I use all the time:

cmd + &#8592; OR &#8594;  go to beginning or end of line from cursors current location, combine with shift to highlight the whole line.

option/alt + &#8592; OR &#8594; jump by word instead of character.

option/alt + click and drag  box style highlighting, also an easy way to create many cursors.

cmd + d find next instance of highlighted word, easily replace key words!

cmd + p quick open file, just start typing the name of the file.

cmd + shift + V paste and indent correctly.

cmd + y redo, opposite of undo.

cmd + x delete line.

cmd + ctrl + &#8593; OR &#8595; bubble line up or down.

cmd + / comment or uncomment selected text/line.

cmd + [ or ] indent or un-indent line or selected lines.

cmd + shift + p open command prompt.
