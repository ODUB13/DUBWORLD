# Peer-Pairing Sessions

## Purpose

Pair programming has gained in popularity among companies by enabling developers to learn from each other and make fewer mistakes. Pair programming can enable both partners to learn and grow if communication is open, friendly, and based on mutual trust and respect. You will learn more effectively through pairing, and your pairing skills will only strengthen with practice. This is why Phase 0 utilizes pair programming as much as it does!

## Expectations

As part of Phase 0, students are expected to pair program with another student in their cohort, from any location, at least **2 times per week** (with the exception of Week 1). Each week has mandatory pairing challenges you will need to pair on.

While it is not mandatory, we encourage students to pair with a different person in each session. Diverse pairing will strengthen your pairing skills more quickly.

It is up to each student to arrange pairing sessions. We suggest posting on the discussion board in Canvas (devbootcamp.instructure.com) to request a pairing session. In your post, it helps to state a time/times (including a time zone) and the challenge you want to pair on. Once another student says they are available to pair, you should decide whether you will attempt the challenge before the agreed upon time or decide to not work on it before the session.

* A peer pairing session must be at least 45 minutes to be counted as one of your sessions.
* You can work on any of the challenges for the week except for the solo challenges.
* You must pair on "Mandatory Pairing" challenges.
* Guided Pairing Sessions (GPS) DO NOT count as peer-pairing sessions.
* You must give feedback to your pair after every session in the Feedback App.

## Courtesy

Please keep in mind that all students are busy and work hard to balance their non-DBC life (work, family, etc.) and Phase 0 requirements. If it turns out you can not make the session you've scheduled for any reason, please contact your pair as soon as possible.

Try your best to work from a quiet place with a reliable Internet connection. It is usually helpful to have headphones for your sessions as well.


## Success Guidelines

You will be successful in your Peer-Pairing sessions if you:

- Check in with your pair according to the [Pairing is Caring](http://vimeo.com/76662569) video.
- Decide which of you will start as the driver and navigator, discuss what each role requires, and stick with it.
- Alternate between driving and navigating. Aim to spend about 50% of your time in each role.
- Keep communication open and tell your pair when you need time to think.
- Ask your pair for their opinions and ideas often.
- Allow yourself to make mistakes.
- Submit feedback to help your pair improve.
- Use feedback you've received to become a better pair.
