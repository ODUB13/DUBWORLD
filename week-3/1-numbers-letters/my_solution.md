# Notes for Numbers and Letters

## Numbers

### Summary
- **What does `puts` do?** Writes on the screen whatever comes after it.
- **What is the difference between float and integer division?** A float is a number with decimals. An integer is basically a whole number.

### Try it!

My solution for:

1.  Hours in a year

```ruby
# multiply days in a year by hours in a day
puts 365*24
```

2. Minutes in a decade

```ruby
# multiply minutes in a hour by hours in a day by days in a year by years in a decade
puts 60*24*365*10
```

## Reflection

Having done the Ruby portion of codecademy and reading the first 6 chapters of Chris Pine's book, this challenge was not too difficult.
I completed the challenges by first reading what was need looking in the book to see what methods I would need, (to see examples) and then writing my code.
I didn't face any problems for the first 3 exercises. The only resources I used where Chris Pine's book and Codecademy.

I did not learn anything I had not previously learned. This was review. I am very confident with Challenge 1 Learning Competencies.
