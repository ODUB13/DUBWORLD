# 5. More Methods Reflection

I learned more in this challenge, but wasn't able to use what I learned in the actual exercises. I was ready to do a littl more array and interation work.
I had a little more difficulty with the second exercise (factorial). I starting working it out without doing pseudocode, then after about 10 minutes realized I might not even be heading down the right direction, so I started over and created a pseudocode outline. Very helpful.
During this challenge, I discovered how useful it is to introduce local variables. Trying to figure out the factorial without adding the "total" variable was not working for me. I really enjoy the trial and error.
I did these challenges on test.rb file I keep that I constantly run to see what stage my code is at.
