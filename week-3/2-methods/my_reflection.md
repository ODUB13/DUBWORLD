# 2. Methods Reflection

I paired for this challenge. Which means I prepared well, because I don't like to be the person during a pairing session that has no idea what's going on.
We split the # of exercises so we could each drive and navigate a few.
This was a pretty straight forward challenge. I did continue to forget to add .to_s or .to_i when necessary. Once I got the error message, I knew to go back. However, I don't remember to do it when I am originally writing the code.
I learned the difference between return and puts, and their importance when used within a method.
I really enjoyed pairing during this challenge. I think both giving directions and coding solidified by Ruby basics.
