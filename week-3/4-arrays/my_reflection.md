 I did half of this challenge with a pair. But I followed the same pattern I did with pervious excercises: Create a pseudo structure of my code and what I need it to do every step of the way, then go find what I need to use to actually make it do what I want. My biggest challenge now is learning to keep it simple. There so mush ruby we're learning that I am trying to implement it all, but sometimes I forget to step back and realize there are very easy and simple solutions.
 For example, in the "Concatenate 2 arrays" exercises, I was trying to figure out how to use push and flatten, only to realize a simple plus sign would do the job.
