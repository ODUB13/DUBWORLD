      <p><b>What is pair programming?</b>
        Pair programming is when 2 people work on one coding project. However, only one person is allowed to work on the code, so it is 2 people working on 1 machine. While one person works on the written code(driver), the other person is directing that person on how to create what they are working on.
      </p>
      <p><b>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</b>
      Pair programming is an important to DBC becasue it helps new and learning programmers to express their thought process. This way they can get feedback from others and also solidify their own learning. It's an also an important process at DBC becasue it prepares developers for pair programing in the professional world.
