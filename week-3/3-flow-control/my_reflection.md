 I did these excercises on my own. I made sure to read Chris Pine thouroughly before even attempting the programs.
 Once I started each challenge, I typed up or at least thought out the pseudo code, that way I could refer to Ruby Docs to find something that could do what I was lokking for.
 My biggest problem thus far is in the details. Multiple times I have misplaced or completely missed an "end", and I've used "puts" rather than "return" inside of methods. It's annoying because I'll run my code over and over in rspec, trying new things, when i finally realize it was righ thte first time, but I had small details wrong.
 Pretty confident in the learning competencies and extremely confident that if I don't know exactly how to use a method, I know exactly where to look to learn to use it.
