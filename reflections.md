#Reflections


Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. You will be expected to complete a reflection for each challenge in Phase 0. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and help your instructors and peers gauge your progress. Reflections are for you, but they will also be read and evaluated by your peers to help you determine where you are in your learning process, so make sure to write for an audience. If you feel more comfortable talking as opposed to writing, you can make video reflections.

Reflections should be about a paragraph long, and only take you about ten minutes to write. You should answer all of the questions in your reflection. If you want to discuss something else on topic, but not specifically addressed in the questions, you should feel free to do that as well.
